Aditi is a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Automation in IISc Bengaluru. She completed her PhD from the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, under the supervision of Prof. Neeldhara Misra.

<br><br><b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
Aditi's research focuses on Computational Social Choice, particularly in Fair Division, Voting, and Matching problems. She is interested in addressing challenges within Algorithmic Game Theory and Multi-Agent Systems. Aditi enjoys tackling complex problems by finding innovative solutions through parameterized, approximate, or randomized approaches, with the goal of ensuring fairness and efficiency in algorithmic decision-making. Her work includes both theoretical explorations and practical implementations, aimed at designing systems that are fair and computationally feasible.
