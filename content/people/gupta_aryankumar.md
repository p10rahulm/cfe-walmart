Aaryan Kumar Gupta is a final year undergraduate student at IIT Bombay and is expecting to graduate this year with a BTech in computer science and a minor in physics. 

<br><br><b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
He is interested in theoretical computer science, in particular approximation algorithms, learning theory, and game theory and wishes to pursue graduate studies in these areas.


<br><br><b>Impact</b><br> One of the cornerstones of geometry is the problem of packing spheres into a container, e.g., a hypercube. It dates back to the 17th century when Kepler conjectured his famous bound on the average density of any packing of spheres in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The problem has been investigated by Lagrange, who solved it in the setting of two dimensions, and by Viazovska who studied the problem in dimension 8 and was awarded the Fields medal in 2022 for her work. A natural corresponding optimization question is the geometric knapsack problem where we are given a set of d-dimensional objects, e.g., hyperspheres, hypercubes, polytopes, etc., each of them having a given profit. The goal is to find the subset of maximum total profit that can be packed non-overlappingly into a given d-dimensional hypercube.  Our work aims to resolve the approximability of this natural question for hyperspheres and other fat objects.
