 Arka Ray is currently a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Automation in IISc, Bengaluru, under Anand Louis. He also finished his master's from IISc. Before that, he did his B. Tech from the University of Calcutta. 

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br><br>
He is broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science. His current work focuses on Approximation Algorithms. He is especially interested in learning more about LP/SDP Hierarchies. He also has worked on inapproximability results for various packing and covering problems.


<b>Impact.</b>  My work has important implications for LP/SDP-based techniques for various problems in general. For example, in a previous work, my co-authors and I showed that the celebrated graph decomposition algorithm cannot be extended to the case of hypergraphs. My current work on Correlation Clustering aims to show fundamental limits on the currently most successful technique for this problem. This work is especially important as Correlation Clustering is also a clustering problem, and clustering has many diverse real-life applications such as analysis of genome data, search results, images, etc. Meanwhile, the work on Linearly-Ordered Coloring provides a very important piece of the puzzle in our understanding of an important question in computational complexity.
