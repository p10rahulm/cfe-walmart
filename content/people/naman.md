Naman is currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the CSA department of IISc. Earlier, he completed his undergraduate studies in computer science from IIIT-Delhi. 

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br><br>
He is currently primarily interested in reinforcement learning and stochastic approximation.


<b>Impact.</b> A loose summary of existing works on distributed learning in the parameter server and multiple worker paradigm is as follows. They consider the scenario where all the worker nodes are estimating a similar quantity, e.g., the gradient at a shared point, and then communicating their estimates to the server synchronously. The server then uses some robust aggregation scheme to reduce the impact of the adversarial estimates, and then use the result to improve upon its solution estimate. In contrast in a network tomography type setting, the worker nodes compute heterogeneous quantities and, importantly, they do so asynchronously. Therefore, existing ideas for dealing with adversaries cannot be directly used in a network tomography type setup. His work develops a novel approach for online learning that handle adversaries in a asynchronous and heterogeneous setup. An extension of this work would have significant impact in vertical federated type applications.
