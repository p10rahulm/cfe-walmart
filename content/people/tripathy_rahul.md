<b>Impact</b>
<br>
This work is relevant because with manycore systems gaining popularity, pre-silicon design space exploration of these systems face many challenges. Full system cycle-accurate simulations take a long time, and almost 90% of this can be spent just to simulate the interconnect. Analytical models cut down this time significantly.
