<b>Research Interests</b>
<br><br>
Causal Reinforcement Learning


<b>Impact.</b> Rahul Madhavan's recent works on fairness and causality, particularly in addressing bias in language models, aim towards developing more equitable AI systems. Through innovative approaches like the use of causal Average Treatment Effect (ATE) to reduce unintended bias and counterfactual augmentation to remove bias in text classification, his research not only tackles the technical challenges of bias mitigation but also lays a framework for developing AI that upholds fairness in language models. Moreover, his research in the area of causal reinforcement learning offers robust frameworks for decision-making, broadening the scope of sample complexity results to encompass new scenarios, including decision-making models in advertising.
