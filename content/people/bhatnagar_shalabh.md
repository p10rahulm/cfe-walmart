Shalabh Bhatnagar is a Senior Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Automation at IISc. He received B.Sc (Hons) in Physics from Delhi University (1988) as well as M.E (1992) and Ph.D (1997) in Electrical Engineering from IISc. He has held Postdoctoral positions at the University of Maryland, College Park, USA (1997-2000) and the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2000-01). He has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Alberta, Canada and IIT Delhi.


<br><br><b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
Shalabhâ€™s research interests are in stochastic approximation algorithms, stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning. He also studies various engineering applications of algorithms and tools from these domains. The most significant work of his and his students has been in (a) providing the first and only sets of verifiable conditions for stability and convergence of stochastic recursions with set-valued maps for both synchronous and asynchronous updates and (b) providing the first convergence analyses of stochastic recursions with set-valued maps (under non-ergodic) Markov noise and both single and multi-time scale settings.

<b>Achievements</b>
<br><br>
He is currently an Associate Editor of the IEEE Control Systems Letters and the Systems and Control Letters journals. He has received several distinctions including the ACCS-CDAC Foundation Award (2017), the Rajib Goyal Young Scientist Prize (2015), Prof. Satish Dhawan Young Engineer Award from the Government of Karnataka (2015), and the Rustom Choksi Award for Excellence in Engineering Research at IISc (2019). He is a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy; the Indian Academy of Sciences; the National Academy of Sciences, India; the Indian National Academy of Engineering; and the Asia-Pacific Artificial Intelligence Association. He was a Senior Associate of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy and is a J.C. Bose National Fellow.
