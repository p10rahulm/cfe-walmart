Prashanth S is currently pursuing his Master's degree at the Department of Computer Science and Automation (CSA) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore.

<br><br><b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
He is currently involved in cutting-edge research at the FIST Lab. His academic journey consists of a fervent dedication to exploring the intersections of high-performance computer architecture, very Large-scale Integration (VLSI), and machine learning.


<br><br><b>Impact</b><br> As I navigate the complexities of hardware design and machine learning integration, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the field, addressing the challenges associated with efficient ASIC Physical Design. Through my work, I aim to empower designers with innovative solutions that facilitate the creation of optimized layouts, aligning with contemporary demands for energy-efficient and compact computing systems. This research also empowers most chip design firms to speed up the chip release life cycle and meet market demands for the hardware.Being part of the vibrant research community at IISc, I am excited about the potential impact of my contributions to the evolving discourse in high-performance computer architecture, VLSI, and machine learning. I look forward to shaping the future of technology by pushing the boundaries of knowledge in these interconnected fields.
