Aditya Subramanian is a fourth year PhD student advised by Prof. Arindam Khan in the Department of Computer Science and Automation, IISc Bangalore. 

<br><br><b>Research Interests</b>
<br><br>
His research interests lie in finding approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, and currently he is taking a closer look at problems in geometric optimization.


<br><br><b>Impact</b><br> In our work on geometric set cover, we develop a new data structure called the extended quadtree, which allows us to tackle the case of hyperrectangles which are known to be the hard cases to solve in many geometric problems. We believe that this data structure might have applications in other problems and help in furthering our knowledge about properties of geometric objects. Our work on rectangle-stabbing has applications in resource allocation problems for computer systems, and the more recent work generalizing it to rectilinear polygons has the scope for adapting the above application to the modern trend of heterogeneous computing by accounting for accelerated cores for specific tasks, or cores of different power envelopes.
