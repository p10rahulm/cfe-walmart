Satyanand Rammohan has been working as a visiting research student in the SPARKS programme at IISc, Bengaluru since 2024. Previously he completed an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol.  Outside of work, he enjoys playing football and hiking and would like to start a podcast someday.

<br><br><b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
His research interests lie in the computational aspects of geometry and topology, including applications to game theory and data analysis 


<br><br><b>Impact</b><br> The basic problem in fair division is: how should a given resource, say a cake, be “fairly” divided among a group of agents, each with different preferences over pieces of the cake? Despite its innocent appearance, the solution to this problem varies wildly in difficulty and computability with factors such as the fairness notion used, the number of agents, and the number of times one is allowed to cut the cake. Fair division is well-studied in both the computer science and economics literature and has been used to develop algorithms for land allocation mechanisms, property disputes, and division of household chores between couples. It turns out that the space of potential solutions (or configuration space) of such problems often carry additional geometric or topological structure, which allows the use of powerful mathematical fixed-point theorems. An auxiliary goal of this project is to deepen and solidify the connection between fair division problems and their configuration spaces, and to investigate the theoretical and computational impact of different choices of configuration spaces and triangulations thereof.
