Kaustubh Kartikey is a second year Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Science in the Department of Computer Science and Automation. He graduated from P.E.S. Institute of Technology, Bengaluru in 2020 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Currently, he is working in the Stochastic Systems Lab under the guidance of Prof. Shalabh Bhatnagar. During my stay at the institute, I have credited several courses relevant to my research domain like â€“ Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra and its Applications, Reinforcement Learning, Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks, Topics in Stochastic Approximation Algorithms, Linear and Non-linear Optimization. I am currently crediting Topics in Stochastic Optimization. My current cumulative grade point is 8.43/10.


<br><br><b>Impact</b><br> Currently, the predominant approach to solve this optimization problem relies on first-order approximation. As a part of my work, we are exploring the application of second-order methods which involve estimating the Hessian along with the gradient of the function in MDPs with functional constraints. This approach is particularly useful as the second-order methods are expected to provide more accurate, reliable and faster convergence than the first-order (or pure gradient) approaches.
