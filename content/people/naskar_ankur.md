Ankur Naskar is a graduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Automation (CSA), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore. For his undergraduate studies, he was enrolled in the 5-year BS-MS dual degree program at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata. He graduated from IISER Kolkata in 2019 with a mathematics major and a physics minor. Afterward, he joined the CSA department at IISc Bangalore in the M.Tech (Research) program. During this period, he was working in the area of Graph theory under Prof. Sunil Chandran. He finished his M.Tech(Research) in 2021. Since then, he has been enrolled as a Ph.D. student with Dr. Gugan Thoppe as his advisor. 

<br><br><b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
I am broadly interested in the areas of stochastic approximation theory, reinforcement learning, and dynamical systems.

<br><br><b>Impact</b><br> A key question with regards to SA schemes is of convergence guarantee and convergence rate. This motivates us to ask whether momentum-based methods can be successfully applied to stochastic algorithms as well. Recent works have suggested that while some momentum-based schemes fail to work in the stochastic setting, other more complex forms of momentum outperform the momentum-less algorithms, even in the stochastic setting. Thus, it is an interesting avenue of research, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint to examine whether the same happens when multiple agents are present. We have derived the first stability and a.s. convergence guarantee on several of these momentum-based DSA schemes. Our main contribution, however, is a generalized proof template that enables us to study a wide class of DSA-M algorithms and extend existing techniques from literature on momentum-less DSA without relying on any restrictive assumptions.
