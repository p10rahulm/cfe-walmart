Gayatri Madduri is currently a Project Associate in the Department of Computer Science and Automation in IISc Bengaluru. She received her Btech (Honors) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad in 2023. She worked on Hardware Accelerators for Genomic Algorithms towards the completion of her honors degree. Thereafter, she worked as an Application Developer in Oracle, India till January 2024. 

 
<br><br><b>Impact</b><br> These Machine Learning Algorithms have risen in prominence due to wide range of applications: Mobile applications and data analysis. It uses an in-situ approach using memristor crossbar arrays, achieving massively parallel computing with high storage density. Many works expanded on the basic IMC architecture to optimize for area, latency and energy. To lower the fabrication cost, a chiplet-based IMC architecture has also been proposed. My work expands on the current work in IMC architecture and attempts to build an efficient Operating System for the IMC architecture.
