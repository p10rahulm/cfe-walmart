                    <div class="card-description">
                        The trends in globalization have dramatically changed in the last few years. Many Fortune 500 companies are eager to enter developing countries and are dependent on finding the right partners in those countries. On the other hand, many developing countries now have home-grown technologies that have leapfrogged the developed countries in areas such as payments solutions, ed-tech platforms, health delivery, and supply chain logistics.

                        Join us to explore how Emerging world AI will shape healthcare, finance, supply chains, and climate science in the coming decades. As we approach 2050, when over 60% of global GDP is projected to come from current emerging markets, this event offers a unique opportunity to shape the future of AI in these rapidly evolving economies.

                        Reinforcement learning (RL) represents a powerful paradigm in artificial intelligence that
                        simulates a learning process akin to natural ways of acquiring knowledge, where agents become
                        competent by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal.
                        In this workshop, we bring together some of the world-leading academicians and industry
                        practitioners to delve into the intricacies and hurdles currently faced by this discipline.
                        We aim to forge pathways that will shape the future of RL, driving forward innovations that
                        promise to transform a multitude of sectors by making systems more adaptive, intelligent,
                        and efficient.

                        The art of Computing workshop was conducted on February 17th and 18th at IISc with several researchers
                        from IISc, Bangalore, IIT Gandhinagar, ICTS, and Brown University.
                        The workshop highlighted numerous avenues of creative expression within Computer Science.
                        We plan to use this opportunity to ignite the imagination and broaden the horizons of many
                        budding computer scientists, particularly senior undergraduates.

                        A workshop on Present and Future Computing Systems was held on 12th - 15th January 2024 at
                        Dept of CSA. In this workshop, several scholars with extensive research experience in the
                        domain of computing systems talked about various aspects of present computing systems as well
                        as how future computing systems will look like. Attendees got a unique opportunity to interact
                        with professionals from leading industries in this domain. Moreover, a team from C-DAC provided
                        a hands-on demonstration of DIR–V VEGA Processor–India's indigenous microcontroller development
                        board.
